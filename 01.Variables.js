//Printing anything in javascript
// use ; at end of statement or you can neglect it
console.log("Hello world");

/*Declaring variables in javascript
variables naming procedure follows camelCase */
// var & let is pretty similar but let is recommended to use rather than var
var first_number = 4;
let second_number = 5;

//accessing variables value
console.log(first_number);
console.log(second_number);

//type checking
console.log(typeof first_number);
console.log(typeof second_number);
